    "### Python\n",
    "Python is popular in artificial intelligence, which is enjoying explosive growth, in part because of its special relationship with data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s an extensive job market for Python programmers across many disciplines, especially in data-science-oriented positions, and Python jobs are among the highest paid of all programming jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anaconda\n",
    "We will use the Anaconda Python distribution because it’s easy to install on Windows, macOS and Linux and supports the latest versions of Python, the IPython interpreter and Jupyter Notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda also includes other software packages and libraries commonly used in Python programming and data science, allowing students to focus on learning Python, computer science and data science, rather than software installation issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "The IPython interpreter and Jupyter Notebook has features that help students and professionals explore, discover and experiment with Python, the Python Standard Library and the extensive set of third-party libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Libraries\n",
    "We will focus on using existing libraries to help you avoid “reinventing the wheel,” thus leveraging your program-development efforts. Often, rather than devel-oping lots of original code—a costly and time-consuming process—you can simply create an object of a pre-existing library class, which takes only a single Python statement. So, libraries will help you perform significant tasks with modest amounts of code. You’ll use a broad range of Python standard libraries, data-science libraries and other third-party libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Python Standard Library \n",
    "provides rich capabilities for text/binary data processing, mathematics, functional-style programming, file/directory access, data persistence, data compression/archiving, cryptography, operating-system services, concurrent program-ming, interprocess communication, networking protocols, JSON/XML/other Internet data formats, multimedia, internationalization, GUI, debugging, profiling and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data-Science Libraries\n",
    "Python has an enormous and rapidly growing community of open-source developers in many fields. One of the biggest reasons for Python’s popularity is the extraordinary range of open-source libraries developed by the open-source community. One of our goals is to create examples, exercises, projects and implementation case studies that give you an engaging, challenging and entertaining introduction to Python programming, while also involving you in hands-on data science, key data-science libraries and more. You’ll be amazed at the substantial tasks you can accomplish in just a few lines of code. The following table lists various popular data-science libraries. You’ll use many of these as you work through our data-science examples, exercises and projects. For visualization, we’ll focus primarily on Matplotlib and Seaborn.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Popular Python libraries used in data science\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Scientific Computing and Statistics\n",
    "NumPy (Numerical Python)—Python does not have a built-in array data structure. It uses lists, which are convenient but relatively slow. NumPy provides the more efficient ndarray data structure to represent lists and matrices, and it also provides routines for processing such data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "SciPy (Scientific Python)—Built on NumPy, SciPy adds routines for scientific processing, such as integrals, differential equations, additional matrix processing and more. scipy.org controls SciPy and NumPy. \n",
    "\n",
    "StatsModels—Provides support for estimations of statistical models, statistical tests and statistical data exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data Manipulation and Analysis \n",
    "Pandas—An extremely popular library for data manipulations. Pandas makes abundant use of NumPy’s ndarray. Its two key data structures are Series (one dimensional) and DataFrames (two dimensional). \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Visualization \n",
    "Matplotlib—A highly customizable visualization and plotting library. Supported plots include regu-lar, scatter, bar, contour, pie, quiver, grid, polar axis, 3D and text. \n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn—A higher-level visualization library built on Matplotlib. Seaborn adds a nicer look-and-feel, additional visualizations and enables you to create visualizations with less code.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "scikit-learn—Top machine-learning library. Machine learning is a subset of AI. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras—One of the easiest to use deep-learning libraries. Keras runs on top of TensorFlow (Google), CNTK (Microsoft’s cognitive toolkit for deep learning) or Theano (Université de Montréal). \n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow—From Google, this is the most widely used deep learning library. TensorFlow works with GPUs (graphics processing units) or Google’s custom TPUs (Tensor processing units) for performance. TensorFlow is important in AI and big data analytics—where processing demands are enormous. You’ll use the version of Keras that’s built into TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI Gym—A library and environment for developing, testing and comparing reinforcement-learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)—Used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "TextBlob—An object-oriented NLP text-processing library built on the NLTK and pattern NLP libraries. TextBlob simplifies many NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gensim—Similar to NLTK. Commonly used to build an index for a collection of documents, then determine how similar another document is to each of those in the index.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing and Executing Code in a Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The Anaconda Python Distribution comes with the Jupyter Notebook—an interactive, browser-based environment in which you can write and execute code and intermix the code with text, images and video. Jupyter Notebooks are broadly used in the data-science community in particular and the broader scientific community in general. They’re the preferred means of doing Python-based data analytics studies and reproducibly communicating their results. The Jupyter Notebook environment actually supports many programming languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How big is big data?\n",
    "For computer scientists and data scientists, data is now as important as writing programs. According to IBM, approximately 2.5 quintillion bytes (2.5 exabytes) of data are created daily, 90% of the world’s data was created in the last two years. According to IDC, the global data supply will reach 175 zettabytes (equal to 175 trillion gigabytes or 175 billion terabytes) annually by 2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Science and Big Data Are Making a Difference: Use Cases\n",
    "The data-science field is growing rapidly because it’s producing significant results that are making a difference. We enumerate data-science and big data use cases in the following table. We expect that the use cases and our examples, exercises and projects will inspire interesting term projects, directed-study projects, capstone-course projects and thesis research. Big-data analytics has resulted in improved profits, better customer relations, and even sports teams winning more games and championships while spending less on players.\n",

    "### Case Study—A Big-Data Mobile Application\n",
    "Google’s Waze GPS navigation app, with its 90 million monthly active users,75 is one of the most widely used big-data apps. Early GPS navigation devices and apps relied on static maps and GPS coordinates to determine the best route to your destination. They could not adjust dynamically to changing traffic situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Waze processes massive amounts of crowdsourced data—that is, the data that’s continuously supplied by their users and their users’ devices worldwide. They analyze this data as it arrives to determine the best route to get you to your destination in the least amount of time. To accomplish this, Waze relies on your smartphone’s Internet connection. The app automatically sends location updates to their servers (assuming you allow it to). They use that data to dynamically re-route you based on current traffic conditions and to tune their maps. Users report other information, such as roadblocks, construction, obstacles, vehicles in breakdown lanes, police locations, gas prices and more. Waze then alerts other drivers in those locations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Waze uses many technologies to provide its services. We’re not privy to how Waze is implemented, but we infer below a list of technologies they probably use. You’ll see many of these in Chapters 12–17. For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "* Most apps created today use at least some open-source software. You’ll take advantage of many open-source libraries and tools throughout this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Waze communicates information over the Internet between their servers and their users’ mobile devices. Today, such data typically is transmitted in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, which we’ll introduce in Chapter 9 and use in subsequent chapters. Often the JSON data will be hidden from you by the libraries you use.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Waze uses speech synthesis to speak driving directions and alerts to you, and speech recognition to understand your spoken commands. We use IBM Watson’s speech-synthesis and speech-recognition capabilities in Chapter 14.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Once Waze converts a spoken natural-language command to text, it must determine the correct action to perform, which requires natural language processing (NLP). We present NLP in Chapter 12 and use it in several subsequent chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Waze displays dynamically updated visualizations such as alerts and maps. Waze also enables you to interact with the maps by moving them or zooming in and out. We create dynamic visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn throughout the book, and we display interactive maps with Folium in Chapters 13 and 17.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Waze uses your phone as a streaming Internet of Things (IoT) device. Each phone is a GPS sensor that continuously streams data over the Internet to Waze. In Chapter 17, we introduce IoT and work with simulated IoT streaming sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Waze receives IoT streams from millions of phones at once. It must process, store and analyze that data immediately to update your device’s maps, to display and speak relevant alerts and possibly to update your driving directions. This requires massively parallel processing capabilities implemented with clusters of computers in the cloud. In Chapter 17, we’ll introduce various big-data infrastructure technologies for receiving streaming data, storing that big data in appropriate databases and processing the data with software and hardware that provide massively parallel processing capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Waze uses artificial intelligence capabilities to perform the data analysis tasks that enable it to predict the best routes based on the information it receives. In Chapters 15 and 16 we use machine learning and deep learning, respectively, to analyze massive amounts of data and make predictions based on that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Waze probably stores its routing information in a graph database. Such databases can efficiently calculate shortest routes. We introduce graph databases, such as Neo4J, in Chapter 17.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many cars are now equipped with devices that enable them to “see” cars and obstacles around them. These are used, for example, to help implement automated braking systems and are a key part of self-driving car technology. Rather than relying on users to report obstacles and stopped cars on the side of the road, navigation apps could take advantage of cameras and other sensors by using deep learning computer vision techniques to analyze images “on the fly” and automatically report those items. We introduce deep learning for computer vision in Chapter 16.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intro to Data Science: Artificial Intelligence—at the Intersection of CS and Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "When a baby first opens its eyes, does it “see” its parent’s faces? Does it understand any notion of what a face is—or even what a simple shape is? Babies must “learn” the world around them. That’s what artificial intelligence (AI) is doing today. It’s looking at massive amounts of data and learning from it. AI is being used to play games, implement a wide range of computer-vision applications, enable self-driving cars, enable robots to learn to perform new tasks, diagnose medical conditions, translate speech to other languages in near real time, create chatbots that can respond to arbitrary questions using massive databases of knowledge, and much more. Who’d have guessed just a few years ago that artificially intelligent self-driving cars would be allowed on our roads or even become common? Yet, this is now a highly competitive area. The ultimate goal of all this learning is artificial general intelligence—an AI that can perform intelligence tasks as well as humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AI: A Field with Problems But No Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "For many decades, AI has been a field with problems and no solutions. That’s because once a particular problem is solved people say, “Well, that’s not intelligence, it’s just a computer program that tells the computer exactly what to do.” However, with machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning we’re not pre-programming solutions to specific problems. Instead, we’re letting our computers solve problems by learning from data and, typically, lots of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the most interesting and challenging problems are being pursued with deep learning. Google alone has thousands of deep-learning projects underway and that number is growing quickly. As you work through this book, we’ll introduce you to many edge-of-the-practice artificial intelligence, big data and cloud technologies and you’ll work through hundreds of (often intriguing) examples, exercises and projects."
